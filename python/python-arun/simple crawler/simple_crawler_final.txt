Rieview :The cover actually arrived before my Google Nexus 7, upon receiving my Google tab (Google Play is kind of slow), I have put it on immediately, it fits like a glove inside.Quality: Well built, nice color, looks like photo shown on website, correct ports opening.Functionality: Does the job nicely, hand free viewing both ways.Price: Very reasonable, shipping was prompt.Weight: Not bulky at all, great to carry around.Verdict: Good buy, I won't spend too much on a tablet that cost even less than my smartphone!

Rieview :Received this case in no time, I ordered a green color case because that is my lucky color. First off, the case are made of pretty decent materials, I am well aware that is not real leather but surprising the quality of the PU leather is not bad with the price tag. It is detachable, can be used both with the base or without it; I have tried to view the tablet in both directions and so far so good. There is a strap in the front for you to secure the front cover. It has all the openings in place, no strange order and no loosen stitches. Will post a following review shortly afterward.

Rieview :This is exactly what I needed for my new Nexus 7.  It fits perfectly, with holes in all the right spots for headphones, the camera, etc.  I was looking for a fancy dock, but this and a pair of cheap speakers I already have gave me exactly what I needed to watch youtube while I do the dishes!  Can't beat it for the price and I really like the light blue color.

Rieview :This case is nothing fancy but works adequately. My Nexus 7 tablet fits snugly in the tablet holder. The snap which connects the tablet holder to the folder swivels a little too easily and the design of the multi angle stand is a little weak. The case does not activate the Nexus 7's automatic Sleep/Wake Function. I'm going to keep this case because it was reasonable priced and fits my current needs but I am considering purchasing a different brand in the future.FYI - this was was available via Amazon Prime 2-day free shipping.  I placed the order for this item at about 12:30 am on a Monday morning and it was on my doorstep on Monday afternoon. Sometimes its nice to live in a town with an Amazon warehouse. I love the convenience of and the range of products available on Amazon and I buy a lot of things from Amazon even though I may regret Amazon's existence one day if online shopping puts brick and mortar retailers out of business.

Rieview :I researched a lot of products on many websites before choosing this. I just purchased a brand new Google Nexus 7 after dropping and rendering useless a less expensive Droid based tablet.  I wanted protection for my new device and I'm a girl - I wanted it to be pretty.  My niece spent $40 at Walmart for a green "leatherette" Nook cover - and I hsve borrowed it a number of times before getting my own tablet.  I like the product I purchased here much better, it has an intelligent design and it is holding up very well.

title : Shuts off device for me too.
Date: January 8, 2013
review rating out of 5.0: 2.0 
Rieview :I am having the same issue as the other review who found that it shuts off their device.  Nexus 7 shuts off at random times when using this case. Often, can not even turn the Nexus on, when you swipe the lock to the edge of the circle and let go it flashes on, then turns off immediately. It was baffling for a while, how on earth can a case be responsible for this? But searching around I think I know what the issue is. There are magnets in the lid of this "smart case" which, when laid on top of the nexus screen will turn of the device. I think the problem is that the magnets are perhaps too strong and are being detected through the back of the Nexus 7 while the lid is open and wrapped around the back of the unit. I confirmed this as follows. With the cover open and pressed against the back, the Nexus shuts off, then when removing the lid off the back of the Nexus, the devices turned on again. Seems to be more of a problem when the lid opens to the right (Asian style book) rather than left (Western style book).

Rieview :I bought this case because I had just purchased my Nexus and we were going on a trip. Fits perfectly and I like the feel.  Doesn't work very well as a stand, because the creases aren't stiff enough. For me that's not a problem because I seldom watch things on it.  Overall its just fine for protecting my Nexus.  Delivery was in credibly fast and color matches the ad. thanks!

Rieview :It exactly fits my Nexus 7. Convenient and comfortable. It is detachable from the stand, so it is very convenient and ease to use. Recommend it!Updated (Aug. 30): Have been using it for some weeks, still like it very much! The case cover protects my Nexus7 pretty well. The color is very nice. I think the pink ones are perfect for girls and women. Also, the wake up function works very well. Highly recommend it!

Rieview :When I first saw this I thought this would be chinsy in quality but this thing is heavy duty.  It is nice and sturdy and well made.  Its convenient that when you open it it also awakes you Nexus. You can also turn it so that its like an easel.  This would make it really nice to cook with....you can be hands free and still read the recipe!  I would really like to see cover come in patterns.  I would buy a second one for sure!!!

Rieview :Hi everybody.  I just received my Nexus 7 case and it is beautifully finished and the details are perfect.  All the pictures are very accurate in their ad.  The cutouts are where they need to be for all functions of the tablet.  I really love the fact that you can pull out the tablet and have a separate sleeve with no cover for holding in your hand. It is soft and comfortable against your skin.The outer cover mates with the inner cover perfectly.  The smart function really works and puts the tablet to sleep when closed, and wakes when opened.  Very cool!  The stand function works great horizontally or vertically and is very easy to change. Magnets keep the tablet closed.I got the pink and it is a very nice color- not too bright or pale.This case is a great value for your money.  Highly recommend.
