I first bought it for the noise because I love sleeping with a very loud noise. It's very calming and I can't here a thing outside on inside, not even the garbage man or annoying birds chirping. I'm 18 now and I bought another one. The one I have had for 11 years still works perfectly but I want another one just in case this one breaks. I travel with this air purifier every where I go in the U.S. and I take it as a carry on. I suffered from allergies and It completely took them away. Everyone in my family has one of these and we never tried any other brand out there. If you don't like loud noise, that's okay because you can put it on medium or low. When we first got them, my dad was worried that we wouldn't be able to here if a burglar comes in so we had to put an alarm system, that's how loud it can get. AMAZING! <br />]]></text><before><![CDATA[I bought my first Honeywell air purifier when I was 7-years-old and I can't live without it!

He's a Katrina rescue & his lungs/throat were <br />damaged from the flood water. The slightist irritation will start him coughing but the minute I let him outside he stops coughing, so I know it's something inside and there's plenty of stuff it could be because this is a Locksmith shop. <br /> It took a few days but his cough got better until finally,it's been about a month, it's gone completely. I know it's the unit because about 2 weeks ago he did <br />start coughing again but stopped as soon as I changed the filter. <br /> I waited until I got my electric bill to write this review. I run the unit on low 24/7 and the bill is no different then before I had it...that's why i gave it five stars...it's worth every penny. <br />]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[I bought this unit for my dog Joey.]]></snippet><after><![CDATA[He's a Katrina rescue & his lungs/throat were damaged from the flood water.]]></after></review><review author="W." id="15785890" published="2010-02-08" rating="5.0" source_id="3" url="http://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001AYI21E"><title><![CDATA[Loud but good]]></title><text><![CDATA[We recently added a second dog to our household, and of course added some new odor too.

I purchased it to use near my umbrella cockatoos cage to control feather dander. You can tell when its on (which is nonstop) opposed to the 3 days I had to have it off in order to find a filter for it locally (I live in ND not easy to come by a lot up here). TO be honest with you I have to change the pre filters even though I do vac. them 2 times a week and the hepa filter more often then recommended or else I get black streaks up my wall. I should have looking back spent 20-30 dollars more and gotten one with a perminate filter. Which I will be getting in a few weeks and this one I will use in another area of my home or give away. I do however give it 4 stars without it I wouldnt be able to keep my parrots, or family healthy due to the amount of dander put off by 2 of my larger birds. Its also not very quiet so expect white noise as one reviewer stated it would be great in a babies room <br />]]></text><before><![CDATA[I should have looking back spent 20-30 dollars more and gotten one with a perminate filter.

I had a Honeywell 18155 and was not impressed with it. <br /> <br />the 17000 is the most efficient and powerful air purifier of it's size. It uses a larger prefilter and True Hepa than it's bigger brother the 18155. Now it does have a more powerful fan than the 18155 and creates more white noise. Not a issue with me but may be to others. I like laying it on its side and let the fan with the filtered air blow to wards me as I cant stand dead uncirculated air. So I quit using my other fan and that less energy used. <br /> <br />I checked the filter after three days and was impressed with how much dust etc had already collected around the prefilter. Something else I noticed, I use to wake up in the middle of the night with nasal congestion and have to have a bottle of water next to my bed. With the 17000 running I now get a better nights sleep and no congestion; guess that dust and pet dander was effecting my rest after all. <br /> <br />I love the 17000 for it's compact size powerful fan and a True HEPA filter.

My only concern was that this model was not powerful enough for a large area and did not have a CADR rating as high as the more expensive model that Honeywell makes (I don't think Target carries this model). But I still bought two of these (one for the living rm. and one for the bedroom). Getting started was simple: unpack, put in the filter, and plug it in. The machine was loud on the high setting, but the sound was actually very calming (perfect to sleep with). For the first time in as long as I can remember, I slept soundly! I woke up with clear sinuses and when I walked into the living room, I could not smell a hint of the cat litter! This model has the ideal power and efficacy for medium-sized rooms.

We bought it for our bedroom to try to cope with my nighttime nasal stuffiness. We had already removed the rug. After owning it a year, we haven't seen any dust accumulation on the inner stage 2 filter.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, our central air/heat filter--where we've installed a top of the line filter--may be taking all the work away from junior, so I can't say for sure whether the fault lies with the filter.
<br />
<br />In other words, it may be that if you've already put a quality inline filter in the central system, this portable filter is redundant.
<br />

I went by Lowes, I am a contractor and had supplies to pick up. In the last month, I have tried the Oreck XL, the Sharper Image Ionic Breeze GP, Honeywell 50250 and the Honeywell IFD. Working around construction dust, smokers and living in a woodsy area, was killing my sinuses and I had developed asthma to the point that I had dark circles under my eyes from not being able to breath good. <br /><br />I really hope this helps someone, I normally wouldn't take this long to write a review. <br /><br />The Sharper Image Ionic Breeze GP, I was skeptical about this one because of the never needing changed filter. I don't think these companies get it, $60-80 a year for a new filter to be able to breath, is not that much. I noticed zero difference in my breathing after a week with the Shaper Image, it went back for a refund. <br /><br />A friend recommended the Oreck, so I ordered one, I live in a one person condo, 3 rooms, living room/kitchen, bedroom and bathroom, the living room is 20x20, the bedroom is 15x20. So my plan was to move the Oreck from one room to the other, then sit it in between the rooms, then sit it right beside my bed at night. There is no question it moves air, my problem is, I'm not for sure it takes much in and you do have to buy the carbon pre-filters, making the commercial about no filters to buy a question. Then they offer you something to smell good, Jasmine, that you somehow get the Oreck XL to blow into the air. First, most of us that are buying a purifier are doing it because of allergies of some sorts, why put a fragrance into the air? It does look like it could just be a way to mask the odors the machine is not picking up. Not happy at all with this one, it was the most expensive of the ones I tried, I returned it after a week.<br /><br />Next was the Honeywell IDF, which stands for Intelligent Design Filter. This works on the same principal that the Sharper Image and Oreck does, you take the main filter out and wash it off, only needing to buy the pre-filters. I will not say this purifier doesn't work, because I did like the way it felt when sitting right near me. The air smelled cleaner and breathing was a little easier, but the problem was the place I bought it, Home Depot, said it would cover a 20 x 20 room, I get it home, check on Honeywell's website to see how to order pre-filters, it is only for a 12 x 15 room, so this isn't going to work and after a few days beside my bed, it didn't seem to be doing as much as it did when I first hooked it up, so I took it back.<br /><br />Back in stock was the Honeywell 50250, this one was my first preference, because they HEPA is changed yearly. But, after two days of pretty clean feeling air, the power button messed up and wouldn't turn off unless I unplugged it. I took it back, the guy at Home Depot said they had a few from the last shipment that did that as well. He gives me another one and 2 days later, this one was not even working, it is like the circuitry of them are messed up. So I got a refund.<br /><br />Then I seen this Hunter 401 at Lowes, first of all, this is bigger than it looks. I would just estimate it to be over 2 foot tall, but it is not very deep so it can fit on most stands or it also has the option to sit on the floor, with legs on the bottom that you can't see from the picture on here. It is fully programmable, you can set the timer to run on high for 3 hours, medium on 4 hours, then low for 2 hours or what I did was run it on high for the first 8 hours I had it, then dropped it down to low. It covers a 19 x 21 room, so it should be big enough for most rooms. <br /><br />The HEPA replacement filter for it is, $79 and must be changed every 8000 hours or 11 months. As I said earlier, it is a small price to pay to breath better. After two weeks of using the Hunter, my sleep is much better. My Doctor believed that I was having asthma attacks in my sleep because there were so many allergens in my condo. Those have all stopped, I wake up, laying the same exact way, on the same side that I go to sleep on. It is a wonderful feeling to be able to breath when I sit up in the morning. For awhile, I would sit up and breath and my lungs felt like they had collapsed during the night. <br /><br />I would recommend this purifier to anyone who isn't looking for what is, "hot" or "the new cool futuristic design" instead wanting performance. I knew Hunter products from using their ceiling fans in some of the houses and businesses that I have been contracted to work on and always believed their fans were the top of the line, without going into the budget breakers. This purifier continues that feeling. If you have a Lowes near, be sure to check there, mine was $178. On a side note, the Honeywell filters are made by Kaz, a solid company, but the Hunter ones are made by 3M, one of the premier companies in the world for quality products. <br /><br />I still have some dark circling under my eyes, but my Doctor says that is from the damage done to my skin around my eyes, it will eventually heal. To me, this time that it took is worth it, because this is how happy I am with this product and I am going to start using them in new houses that want purifiers. By the way, these are very easy to check and change the filters, the front just snaps off, then snaps back on and there is a digital readout on top that tells the time, and shows the use of the filters. <br /><br />Great product!]]></text><before><![CDATA[There is no question it moves air, my problem is, I'm not for sure it takes much in and you do have to buy the carbon pre-filters, making the commercial about no filters to buy a question.

I purchased the first one brand-new. I replaced the pre-filter on a regular basis as needed before the timer recommended it, and I changed the filter when told to do so by the digital filter life monitor. This was used in a large climate-controlled bedroom. The unit is only used during sleeping or when the room was aired out or cleaned. <br /> <br />The unit works great, but the motor hasn't lasted. I started getting headaches while sleeping and eventually I noticed an electrical burning smell. I traced it back to the air cleaner. I called Hunter and they had me cut the power cord and return the cord when they send me a new unit (they asked me to dispose of the defective unit). They replaced the entire unit with a brand new 30401! Great customer service, it was all paid for and I was good to go. Before disposing of the old unit, I opened it up to take a look and oil was leaking out from the motor and it smelled like "electrical burn" smell. <br /> <br />1.5 years later, the replacement unit did the same thing. I hadn't been sleeping well lately, and last night I had a headache, so I smelled the air coming from the unit and it smelled like something burning. I turned it off and waited the next day to take a look at it. The same thing: The oil from the motor is leaking and it smells like it's burning. <br /> <br />So if you are getting headaches - try sleeping with the air cleaner OFF and air out the room! This could be the culprit. The smell isn't noticeable at first but it does effect the air you breath. I also noticed the Hunter label that says "MADE IN TAIWAN". I don't know if this also applies to the motor, but it's too risky to have this replaced and have this happen again. I am stuck with some extra filters but I would rather buy a completely different brand and unit then to risk my health again running this unit while I am sleeping.]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[This is my second Hunter QuietFlo 30401 that the motor leaked and polluted the air after over 1-2 years of use.]]></snippet><after><![CDATA[I purchased the first one brand-new.]]></after></review><review id="15789052" published="2006-06-01" rating="3.5" source_id="5079" url="http://www.allergybuyersclubshopping.com/hunter-quietflo-air-purifiers.html?psysVid=08l9mjsg"><text><![CDATA[...these machines offer the convenience of digital displays with easy filter change reminders and have 3 adjustable fan speeds.]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[...these machines offer the convenience of digital displays with easy filter change reminders and have 3 adjustable fan speeds.]]></snippet></review></review_list></product></response><response status="ok"><product displayable_review_count="22" id="7" name="Honeywell QuietCare 17000 Air Purifier" nextag_ptitle_id="737226276" overall_rating="4.5" recommended_count="99" release_date="2000-08-14" review_count="125" sources_count="11" wizerank="89"><rating_list><rating rating="5" review_count="67"/><rating rating="4" review_count="32"/><rating rating="3" review_count="7"/><rating rating="2" review_count="8"/><rating rating="1" review_count="11"/></rating_list><source_list><source average_rating="4.36364" id="3" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/3.gif" name="www.amazon.com" review_count="66"/><source average_rating="3.34286" id="3155" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/3155.gif" name="www.shopping.com" review_count="35"/><source average_rating="4.0" id="60" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/60.gif" name="www.target.com" review_count="6"/><source average_rating="4.63333" id="2743" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/2743.gif" name="www.circuitcity.com" review_count="6"/><source average_rating="4.33333" id="120" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.buydig.com" review_count="3"/><source average_rating="4.0" id="1234" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/1234.gif" name="www.shopzilla.com" review_count="2"/><source average_rating="4.0" id="208" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/208.gif" name="www.drugstore.com" review_count="2"/><source average_rating="5.0" id="11639" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="toysrus.com" review_count="2"/><source average_rating="5.0" id="1602" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.beachaudio.com" review_count="1"/><source average_rating="5.0" id="146" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.radioshack.com" review_count="1"/><source average_rating="5.0" id="114" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/114.gif" name="www.newegg.com" review_count="1"/></source_list><topic_list><topic id="43375" name="Allergen" recommended_count="38" score="0.832051"/><topic id="128381" name="People With Allergies" recommended_count="38" score="0.832051"/><topic id="25903" name="Room" recommended_count="34" score="0.793243"/><topic id="25902" name="Work" recommended_count="31" score="0.788235"/><topic id="2194" name="Sleep" recommended_count="28" score="0.77931"/></topic_list><pro_list><pro id="60766" name="Noise" recommended_count="30" score="0.827419"/><pro id="128405" name="Low Speed Quietness" recommended_count="68" score="0.815789"/><pro id="128404" name="High Speed Quietness" recommended_count="28" score="0.77931"/><pro id="1828" name="Dust" recommended_count="22" score="0.773913"/><pro id="78881" name="Quietness" recommended_count="54" score="0.7625"/></pro_list><review_list><review author="Amanda Michelle" id="15785836" published="2010-11-10" rating="5.0" source_id="3" url="http://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001AYI21E"><title><![CDATA[AMAZING!]]></title><text><![CDATA[I bought my first Honeywell air purifier when I was 7-years-old and I can't live without it!

I'm 18 now and I bought another one. The one I have had for 11 years still works perfectly but I want another one just in case this one breaks. I travel with this air purifier every where I go in the U.S. and I take it as a carry on. I suffered from allergies and It completely took them away. Everyone in my family has one of these and we never tried any other brand out there. If you don't like loud noise, that's okay because you can put it on medium or low. When we first got them, my dad was worried that we wouldn't be able to here if a burglar comes in so we had to put an alarm system, that's how loud it can get.

I decided to replace the unit with the 17005 as it's programmable with remote. So far, so good... <br /> <br />Yes the 17000 and 17005 create a white noise, air pushing sound, which I like anyway (kills noises for sleeping), but it's not deafening, and if it bothers you throw it in the corner of the room; it will cycle the air the same. I would disagree that it's as loud as an a/c-- those things roar! <br /> <br />Anyway, these two websites might help you make your decision, too. <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />About CADR Ratings]]></text><before><![CDATA[I owned the Honeywell 17000 for 10 years- since '99- and it finally broke a few months ago.

I had a Honeywell 18155 and was not impressed with it. <br /> <br />the 17000 is the most efficient and powerful air purifier of it's size. It uses a larger prefilter and True Hepa than it's bigger brother the 18155. Now it does have a more powerful fan than the 18155 and creates more white noise. Not a issue with me but may be to others. I like laying it on its side and let the fan with the filtered air blow to wards me as I cant stand dead uncirculated air. So I quit using my other fan and that less energy used. <br /> <br />I checked the filter after three days and was impressed with how much dust etc had already collected around the prefilter. Something else I noticed, I use to wake up in the middle of the night with nasal congestion and have to have a bottle of water next to my bed. With the 17000 running I now get a better nights sleep and no congestion; guess that dust and pet dander was effecting my rest after all. <br /> <br />I love the 17000 for it's compact size powerful fan and a True HEPA filter. I sleep better now than I have ever have.]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[I purchased mine for my bedroom a we have three dogs and a problem with dust and dander.]]></snippet><after><![CDATA[I had a Honeywell 18155 and was not impressed with it.]]></after></review><review author="Flywheel" id="15785900" published="2008-10-30" rating="5.0" source_id="114" url="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16896113046&amp;Pagesize=100"><title><![CDATA[Pros: This Air Purifier is great after 1 day of operation u can tell a big difference in the air quality of a room.]]></title><text><![CDATA[Pros: This Air Purifier is great after 1 day of operation u can tell a big difference in the air quality of a room.

My only concern was that this model was not powerful enough for a large area and did not have a CADR rating as high as the more expensive model that Honeywell makes (I don't think Target carries this model). But I still bought two of these (one for the living rm. and one for the bedroom). Getting started was simple: unpack, put in the filter, and plug it in. The machine was loud on the high setting, but the sound was actually very calming (perfect to sleep with). For the first time in as long as I can remember, I slept soundly! I woke up with clear sinuses and when I walked into the living room, I could not smell a hint of the cat litter! This model has the ideal power and efficacy for medium-sized rooms.

I went by Lowes, I am a contractor and had supplies to pick up. In the last month, I have tried the Oreck XL, the Sharper Image Ionic Breeze GP, Honeywell 50250 and the Honeywell IFD. Working around construction dust, smokers and living in a woodsy area, was killing my sinuses and I had developed asthma to the point that I had dark circles under my eyes from not being able to breath good. <br /><br />I really hope this helps someone, I normally wouldn't take this long to write a review. <br /><br />The Sharper Image Ionic Breeze GP, I was skeptical about this one because of the never needing changed filter. I don't think these companies get it, $60-80 a year for a new filter to be able to breath, is not that much. I noticed zero difference in my breathing after a week with the Shaper Image, it went back for a refund. <br /><br />A friend recommended the Oreck, so I ordered one, I live in a one person condo, 3 rooms, living room/kitchen, bedroom and bathroom, the living room is 20x20, the bedroom is 15x20. So my plan was to move the Oreck from one room to the other, then sit it in between the rooms, then sit it right beside my bed at night. There is no question it moves air, my problem is, I'm not for sure it takes much in and you do have to buy the carbon pre-filters, making the commercial about no filters to buy a question. Then they offer you something to smell good, Jasmine, that you somehow get the Oreck XL to blow into the air. First, most of us that are buying a purifier are doing it because of allergies of some sorts, why put a fragrance into the air? It does look like it could just be a way to mask the odors the machine is not picking up. Not happy at all with this one, it was the most expensive of the ones I tried, I returned it after a week.<br /><br />Next was the Honeywell IDF, which stands for Intelligent Design Filter. This works on the same principal that the Sharper Image and Oreck does, you take the main filter out and wash it off, only needing to buy the pre-filters. I will not say this purifier doesn't work, because I did like the way it felt when sitting right near me. The air smelled cleaner and breathing was a little easier, but the problem was the place I bought it, Home Depot, said it would cover a 20 x 20 room, I get it home, check on Honeywell's website to see how to order pre-filters, it is only for a 12 x 15 room, so this isn't going to work and after a few days beside my bed, it didn't seem to be doing as much as it did when I first hooked it up, so I took it back.<br /><br />Back in stock was the Honeywell 50250, this one was my first preference, because they HEPA is changed yearly. But, after two days of pretty clean feeling air, the power button messed up and wouldn't turn off unless I unplugged it. I took it back, the guy at Home Depot said they had a few from the last shipment that did that as well. He gives me another one and 2 days later, this one was not even working, it is like the circuitry of them are messed up. So I got a refund.<br /><br />Then I seen this Hunter 401 at Lowes, first of all, this is bigger than it looks. I would just estimate it to be over 2 foot tall, but it is not very deep so it can fit on most stands or it also has the option to sit on the floor, with legs on the bottom that you can't see from the picture on here. It is fully programmable, you can set the timer to run on high for 3 hours, medium on 4 hours, then low for 2 hours or what I did was run it on high for the first 8 hours I had it, then dropped it down to low. It covers a 19 x 21 room, so it should be big enough for most rooms. <br /><br />The HEPA replacement filter for it is, $79 and must be changed every 8000 hours or 11 months. As I said earlier, it is a small price to pay to breath better. After two weeks of using the Hunter, my sleep is much better. My Doctor believed that I was having asthma attacks in my sleep because there were so many allergens in my condo. Those have all stopped, I wake up, laying the same exact way, on the same side that I go to sleep on. It is a wonderful feeling to be able to breath when I sit up in the morning. For awhile, I would sit up and breath and my lungs felt like they had collapsed during the night. <br /><br />I would recommend this purifier to anyone who isn't looking for what is, "hot" or "the new cool futuristic design" instead wanting performance. I knew Hunter products from using their ceiling fans in some of the houses and businesses that I have been contracted to work on and always believed their fans were the top of the line, without going into the budget breakers. This purifier continues that feeling. If you have a Lowes near, be sure to check there, mine was $178. On a side note, the Honeywell filters are made by Kaz, a solid company, but the Hunter ones are made by 3M, one of the premier companies in the world for quality products. <br /><br />I still have some dark circling under my eyes, but my Doctor says that is from the damage done to my skin around my eyes, it will eventually heal. To me, this time that it took is worth it, because this is how happy I am with this product and I am going to start using them in new houses that want purifiers. By the way, these are very easy to check and change the filters, the front just snaps off, then snaps back on and there is a digital readout on top that tells the time, and shows the use of the filters. <br /><br />Great product!]]></text><before><![CDATA[There is no question it moves air, my problem is, I'm not for sure it takes much in and you do have to buy the carbon pre-filters, making the commercial about no filters to buy a question.

I purchased the first one brand-new. I replaced the pre-filter on a regular basis as needed before the timer recommended it, and I changed the filter when told to do so by the digital filter life monitor. This was used in a large climate-controlled bedroom. The unit is only used during sleeping or when the room was aired out or cleaned. <br /> <br />The unit works great, but the motor hasn't lasted. I started getting headaches while sleeping and eventually I noticed an electrical burning smell. I traced it back to the air cleaner. I called Hunter and they had me cut the power cord and return the cord when they send me a new unit (they asked me to dispose of the defective unit). They replaced the entire unit with a brand new 30401! Great customer service, it was all paid for and I was good to go. Before disposing of the old unit, I opened it up to take a look and oil was leaking out from the motor and it smelled like "electrical burn" smell. <br /> <br />1.5 years later, the replacement unit did the same thing. I hadn't been sleeping well lately, and last night I had a headache, so I smelled the air coming from the unit and it smelled like something burning. I turned it off and waited the next day to take a look at it. The same thing: The oil from the motor is leaking and it smells like it's burning. <br /> <br />So if you are getting headaches - try sleeping with the air cleaner OFF and air out the room! This could be the culprit. The smell isn't noticeable at first but it does effect the air you breath. I also noticed the Hunter label that says "MADE IN TAIWAN". I don't know if this also applies to the motor, but it's too risky to have this replaced and have this happen again. I am stuck with some extra filters but I would rather buy a completely different brand and unit then to risk my health again running this unit while I am sleeping.]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[This is my second Hunter QuietFlo 30401 that the motor leaked and polluted the air after over 1-2 years of use.]]></snippet><after><![CDATA[I purchased the first one brand-new.]]></after></review><review id="15789052" published="2006-06-01" rating="3.5" source_id="5079" url="http://www.allergybuyersclubshopping.com/hunter-quietflo-air-purifiers.html?psysVid=08l9mjsg"><text><![CDATA[...these machines offer the convenience of digital displays with easy filter change reminders and have 3 adjustable fan speeds.]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[...these machines offer the convenience of digital displays with easy filter change reminders and have 3 adjustable fan speeds.]]></snippet></review></review_list></product><product displayable_review_count="20" id="177" name="Honeywell HHT-080 Air Purifier" nextag_ptitle_id="668542669" overall_rating="3.8" recommended_count="29" release_date="2006-02-03" review_count="43" sources_count="7" wizerank="76"><rating_list><rating rating="5" review_count="19"/><rating rating="4" review_count="10"/><rating rating="3" review_count="2"/><rating rating="2" review_count="7"/><rating rating="1" review_count="5"/></rating_list><source_list><source average_rating="3.15" id="3" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/3.gif" name="www.amazon.com" review_count="20"/><source average_rating="4.6875" id="3815" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/3815.gif" name="reviews.homedepot.com" review_count="16"/><source average_rating="3.66667" id="3155" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/source_favicons/3155.gif" name="www.shopping.com" review_count="3"/><source average_rating="2.0" id="151" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.cameraworld.com" review_count="1"/><source average_rating="2.0" id="152" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.wolfcamera.com" review_count="1"/><source average_rating="2.0" id="153" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.ritzcamera.com" review_count="1"/><source average_rating="5.0" id="1602" image_url="http://d14a29lqfzq7m7.cloudfront.net/images/v4/logo/favicon_generic.gif" name="www.beachaudio.com" review_count="1"/></source_list><topic_list><topic id="25902" name="Work" recommended_count="11" score="0.708333"/><topic id="128381" name="People With Allergies" recommended_count="8" score="0.7"/><topic id="43405" name="Pet" recommended_count="6" score="0.7"/><topic id="2158" name="Dander" recommended_count="6" score="0.7"/><topic id="2187" name="Pet Owners" recommended_count="6" score="0.7"/></topic_list><pro_list><pro id="72844" name="Dust Removal" recommended_count="6" score="0.7"/><pro id="1828" name="Dust" recommended_count="6" score="0.642857"/><pro id="50776" name="Odor Control" recommended_count="5" score="0.633333"/><pro id="137355" name="Filter Replacement Indicator" recommended_count="1" score="0.6"/><pro id="137321" name="Cooling Ability" recommended_count="3" score="0.6"/></pro_list><review_list><review id="15789202" published="2009-01-29" rating="4.0" source_id="3" url="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000ANCV1S%26tag=wizecom-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/gp/product/customer-reviews/B000ANCV1S/ref=nosim"><title><![CDATA[Initial review]]></title><text><![CDATA[I just bought the HHT-080.

Our 4yo daughter has severe environmental allergies (grasses, cat dander, and molds) and had been complaining of "Stuffy nose!" and waking up at night, despite the older HEPA being in her room. No longer trusting it to our daughter's room, I bought this one from our local HD based on nothing more than the name, the marketing on the packaging comparing it to other Honeywells, and the fact that the permanent filters (yay!) were encased in a rubberized plastic (some are cardboard/pressboard).That was four nights ago, and our daughter has slept in her 12x13 room allergy-free since. We have it on low 24hrs/day WITHOUT the ionizer (research that before you use it). It's still somewhat noisy on low, but as our kids sleep better with a little whitenoise, we actually wanted that. High would probably be too noisy to watch TV in the same room. There's also a "fresh" smell without the ionizer -- perhaps the antimicrobial treatment on the filters???So far, it's a GREAT purifier! We're hoping it continues to perform this way because we want one for our room now and maybe another for the living room after that.]]></text><before><![CDATA[We had a Honeywell HEPA purifier for about three years when it started smelling like oil after changing the expensive paper filter.]]></before><snippet><![CDATA[Our 4yo daughter has severe environmental allergies (grasses, cat dander, and molds) and had been complaining of "Stuffy nose!" and waking up at night, despite the older HEPA being in her room.]]></snippet><after><![CDATA[No longer trusting it to our daughter's room, I bought this one from our local HD based on nothing more than the name, the marketing on the packaging comparing it to other Honeywells, and the fact that the permanent filters (yay!) were encased in a rubberized plastic (some are cardboard/pressboard).]]></after></review><review id="15789201" published="2007-04-18" rating="4.0" source_id="3" url="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000ANCV1S%26tag=wizecom-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/gp/product/customer-reviews/B000ANCV1S/ref=nosim"><title><![CDATA[Somewhat noisy]]></title><text><![CDATA[I just bought 2 of them for both bedrooms and one of them was very quiet, but the other one made awful rattling noise.

But you get what you pay for.]]></title><text><![CDATA[I bought this item around 3 months ago at Bestbuy. I remember the clerk was telling how great this item was and how it sold out quickly. Right then, not having done much research and limited with budget, with the mind of taking risk by trying something new especially after the "salesman talk" i decided to buy it. <br /><br />Purely focus on the actually funtion of this machine. I am living in a two bed rooms apartment where it tend to get real dusty due to the age of the house. I placed the machine in my bedroom where i have it running 24/7. For the very few days i actually realize some changes to the quality of the air and the room is fill with ionic scent which is rather pleasnt. <br /><br />But couple weeks later, though still under the condition of running it 24/7 on high. The freshness of the air has disappeared. In addition, i started to get this low-humming vibrating sound like all other reviewers have encountered. It's most obvious when you run on high along with the annoying loud fan noise.(which is like adding fuel to fire) I was able to live with the loud fan noise, but definitely not the vibrating sound where it sounds like ancient appliance. One thing i found was that in both of my friend and mine's cases of running air purifier most of the time with different purifers, mine being the HHT-080 and my friend's being the $299 Brookstone purifier(which you can also find on amazon) The surrounding area and the case of the purifiers tend to get dirty and dusty and in his case his good looking IPOD white purifier now look all grey and dusty and even old. Though all it takes is to clean it with a wet cloth. In my case, the dust on the case isnt' as severe mainly cuz mine was black and the texture definitely makes a lot of difference. Just be aware of this situation when you run it often enough. Not sure if this is normal or just rare.<br /><br />well, you get what you pay for. It's funny for me to think that i will be able to get a Good air purifier with nonplaceble filer with such a low price. If you have a higher or no budget then definitely look for something better. Or at least do your research.<br /><br />PS: there is one cident that I would like to share.(True story and none of this was made up) One day my friend came to my apartment for a sleepover. The next morning when i woke up, i saw my friend awaked sitting next to my bed. I asked him why he got up so early. He told me that he actually was awakened by the loud noise of my air-purifier.Though havn't happened to me.<br /><br />In conclusion, the reason why i gave it a 3 stars is because despite all my complaints there is still some quality to it(despite its expected function) Now i mainly use this device as a fan to keep my room cool and whenever i have it on it gives me a feeling of better circulation of the air which might not be necessarily true.]]></text><before><![CDATA[I am living in a two bed rooms apartment where it tend to get real dusty due to the age of the house.

On top of the stardard and expected noise of moving air, there's a vibrating plastic noise as well. It sounded as it the fans were not properly balanced and thus created an unavoidable and unfixable vibration. However, this might have just been my particular unit.<br />I did run it for about 3 hours in my bedroom (with the door closed because of the noise) and when I went to bed I noticed a slight change in alergies, but due to the fact that I couldn't run it in the room while I slept, I still woke up with a stuffy nose, and itchy red eyes...<br />Don't buy this product if you enjoy watching tv in your living room, or sleeping in your bedroom.]]></text><snippet><![CDATA[I returned this air purifier within 18 hours of purchasing it.]]></snippet><after><![CDATA[Even on it's lowest setting the amount of air noise this thing generates is unbearable, especially in a 900 square foot apartment.]]></after></review><review id="15789207" published="2010-03-13" rating="2.0" source_id="3" url="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000ANCV1S%26tag=wizecom-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/gp/product/customer-reviews/B000ANCV1S/ref=nosim"><title><![CDATA[Noisy, ineffective, ozone]]></title><text><![CDATA[It's noisy even on the lowest speed and can't be ignored in a quiet room; and yes, I removed the plastic wrapping on the filters first.
