DS Questions Array
==================
Data Structure code written in c++ language

1. Given a Binary Tree, extract all leaves of it in a Doubly Linked List (DLL). Note that the DLL need to be created in-place. Assume that the node structure of DLL and Binary Tree is same, only the meaning of left and right pointers are different. In DLL, left means previous pointer and right means next pointer.
2. Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp. For example, the program should print true for exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” and false for exp = “[(])”
3. Convert number to ROMAN string.
4. Convert ROMAN string to number.
5. Inversion Count for an array indicates – how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
6. Given a number n, find the smallest number that has same set of digits as n and is greater than n. If x is the greatest possible number with its set of digits, then print “not possible”.
7. Given a number n, find the greatest number that has same set of digits as n and is less than n. If x is the greatest possible number with its set of digits, then print “not possible”.
8. Given a positive number what is the best algorithm to find the smallest number greater than the given number which is a palindrome.
9. Given a positive number what is the best algorithm to find the largest number less than the given number which is a palindrome.
10. power(x,y) logn approach
11. quotient and remainder
12. search element in pivoted rotated array
13. Given two strings string1 and string2, find the smallest substring in string1 containing all characters of string2 efficiently.
